# Memento App
This is the alpha testing of the Memento App.

Description written by Matias Riveros-Amado

Credits are at the top of every Swift file.

Work utilized: https://github.com/natsu1211/Alarm-ios-swift.git 
The store, notifSaver, and notif Swift files used the models in this project (under MIT license) as a base to work on top of. Substantial changes were made (addition of variables, methods, etc.)

This app is meant to help older people with/developing Alzheimer's disease keep track of important daily task, remind themselves of memories, and keep their mind sharps. Though it is designed to be a tool to AID people with Alzheimer's, it should not be misconstrued as a "solution."
It can be helpful for the general aging population, not just those with Alzheimer's, to keep their minds healthy through brain exercise.

Works in progress:
- Photo Journal: While it is functional, the model has to be converted into persistent data before it is expanded upon.
- Interactions: All references to this feature have been commented out because it causes bugs with other persistent data. The beta testing video is included below.
- Brain Games: new brain games are still in development.
